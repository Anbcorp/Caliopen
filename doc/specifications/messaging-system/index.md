# Messaging system in Caliopen
Caliopen relies on **nats** messaging system to exchange data between services.  
Most of the time, messages sent on **nats** are small json documents emitted by a service to trigger an action by another service. As a matter of fact, Caliopen needs a **nats** server up and running to work properly.  
All **nats** modes may be used by services :Â asynchronous/synchronous, publish/subscribe, request/reply, etc. depending on use case.
