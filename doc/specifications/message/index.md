## Discussion association

A discussion can be directly associated to a message in case of a reply so the participants will not be editable.

## Reply or Compose a message

For a new message (compose button), we let the user choose the recipients and save it as is.
The user can change the recipients with no restrictions.
The `discussion_id` is calculated by the backend each time the draft is saved.
The `parent_id` is `undefined` if it is a new draft (compose).

In case of a reply, the `parent_id` is set by the client.
And the backend accepts a `discussion_id` and `participants` but it will recalc the `discussion_id` and the `participants` each time the reply is saved.
